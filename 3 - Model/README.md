# Model

The statistical model used in these analyses is similar to that proposed
in McLain et al. (2019) and discussed in more detail therein. The
general model is a penalized longitudinal mixed-model with a
heterogeneous error term. The model uses economic data, along with country, 
regional, and global trends to predict the outcomes for countries and years 
with no data sources. Specifically, the outputs of the model are used to 
predict country level trends in stunting and overweight. Non-linear 
longitudinal patterns in the outcomes are captured using penalized cubic 
B-splines, with country-specific intercepts and random cubic B-splines. The 
connection between penalized spline smoothing and linear mixed-effects models
(Currie and Durban 2002) allows the model to penalize the likelihood to
estimate the B-spline coefficients.

## Model Details

- **Heterogeneous Penalized Longitudinal Mixed-Model**: The model
  includes penalized cubic B-splines to capture non-linear longitudinal
  patterns, with country-specific intercepts and random cubic B-splines.
  The heterogeneous error term corrects for the fact that the SSE varies
  by study.
- **Model Fitting**: The model is fitted as a linear mixed model, with
  random effects chosen to penalize the likelihood when the B-spline
  coefficients are not constant.
- **Random B-Spline Coefficients**: The number of random B-spline
  coefficients is selected based on corrected Akaike information
  criterion (AICc).
- **Covariance Matrix Selection**: The covariance matrix of the random
  splines is selected by testing variance components, compound
  symmetric, and unstructured specifications, choosing the type that
  minimizes AICc.
- **Confidence and Prediction Intervals**: The model provides accurate
  confidence intervals and prediction intervals as demonstrated in
  McLain et al. (2019).

## Usage

To run the analysis on the multiply imputed dataset, follow the
instructions below:

1.  Open the `1 - Analysis_MI.R` file.
2.  Set the working directory (`wd`) to the folder that contains the
    **“3 - Model”** folder.

### Arguments

- **marker**: Set this to `"Stunting"` or `"Overweight"`.
- **year/month**: Needed to find the data. This should correspond to the
  `year` and `month` values used in the data cleaning process.
- **marker_f**: Used to append the file name for situations where
  multiple models need to be run.

### Script Sections

1.  **Setting Model Parameters** (lines 13 - 49):

    - In this section, the fixed and random effect parameters can be set
      for either indicator (Stunting or Overweight).

2.  **Running and Outputting the Models** (lines 58 - ):

    - This section runs the analyses for each imputed dataset and
      outputs the results.
